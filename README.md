# Algorithm Design and Analysis
## Final Project
The project is has 2 problems:
### Problem 1
Given a set of **_N_** jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it. Each **_job<sub>i</sub>_** takes **_1_** unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit associated with job if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. Find the **_number of jobs_** done and the **_maximum profit_**. Jobs will be given in the form `(job_id, deadline, profit)` associated with that Job.

**Sample Input**
```python
jobs = {(1,4,20),(2,1,10),(3,1,40),(4,1,30)}
```

**Solution**
```python
# TODO
```

### Problem 2
You are given a list of **_N_** jobs with their start time, end time, and the profit you can earn by doing that job. Your task is to find the **_maximum profit_** you can earn by picking up some (or all) jobs, ensuring **_no two jobs overlap_**. If you choose a job that ends at time **_X_**, you will be able to start another job that starts at time **_X_**.

**Sample Input**
```python
jobs = {(1, 6, 6), (2, 5, 5), (5, 7, 5), (6, 8, 3)}
```
**Solution**
```python
# TODO
```
